				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<!-- eaach <p></p> is a seperate paragraph -->
				<p>Currently I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at Illinois Institute of Technology graduating in May and a part time Software Quality Assurance Automation Engineer intern at Oracle. I am a highly motivated person working alongside intelligent and highly motivated classmates and team members.</p>
				<p>Some of my responsibilities at Oracles are manually run through test cases then automating them for future automation runs on large complex systems using Java-based Selenium. When manual test cases are no longer valid I would work with developers and business analyst to determine what the best course of action would be for that test suite, how the test case should be adjusted or be removed altogether. Every other day development team pushes their code to a branch where we run our automated test cases on to make sure the new code has not broken anything unexpected. Typically, an automation run on Jenkins takes about an hour to run 7000 test cases at 180 instances on a VM. So far I have created and automated around 600+ test cases at Oracle in a four-month span. Besides automating test cases my team and I do code review every week. Code review is a time where I get to learn from the teamâ€™s mistake and stay up to date on different automation techniques.</p>
				<p>I value my time at Oracle as an intern and always looking for ways to improve both myself and the company by taking on more responsibility on the team. I hope to bring my experience in testing, automation, and teamwork skills and enthusiasm for quality assurance to your company.</p>
